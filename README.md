jQuery Simple Modal: Unobtrusive Modal Dialog
=============================================

SimpleModal is a jQuery plugin for loading a modal dialog on your pages with
clean unobtrusive javascript.

It has no external dependencies other than jQuery, and you don't need to write
a single line of JavaScript to get it to work.


How to Use
----------

Include the javascript file in your page:

    <script src="simple-modal.js"></script>

Modal-ize any links you like:

    <a href="some-page.html" data-modal="true">Open a modal</a>

You can also create a modal out of page anchor links:

    <a href="#some-id" data-modal="true">Open a modal</a>
